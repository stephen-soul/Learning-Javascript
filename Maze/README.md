# What is it?
Maze done in Javascript based off this example http://dstromberg.com/2013/07/tutorial-random-maze-generation-algorithm-in-javascript/. The
example is one to generate a random maze without the use of the canvas.Took that code and added a bunch of movement options
(key down, on screen buttons and arrow keys) to allow a player (symbolized by a monkey) to gather the prize (symbolized by a banana.)
Score is tracked and names are saved in session.
